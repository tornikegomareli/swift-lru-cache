READ and UNDERSTAND the README.md file in the project's root folder, if it is available.  This will help you understand the project from ther user's perspective.
THEN run git ls-files to understand the files in this project.
THEN READ and UNDERSTAND the PLANNING.md file in the project's root folder, if it is available.  This will give you important context about the project, and instructions on how to build and test.
THEN READ and UNDERSTAND the TASK.md file in the project's root folder, if it is available.  This will give you important context about what tasks have been accomplished, and what work is left to do, to the best of our knowledge.
UPDATE the TASK.md file with each change that you make to the project.  This is important, because it will give you context on future sessions.  ONLY UPDATE if there are changes to the project, not just reading files.
UPDATE the PLANNING.md file if our changes have altered the information in that file.
DO NOT READ any files that are in the project's external/ directory.  Those are files intended to be used elsewhere and either repeat information or would adversely affect your ability to understand the project.
